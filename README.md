# RDs-BDT
Hello dear reader! This is a repository for understanding the Boosted Decision Tree algorithm in distinguishing between signal and background for the B_s. Enjoy and keep researching!

## First of all what the hell even is RDs? And what even is a BDT?
### 1. R(Ds):
Non-elementary particles are extremely small objects that are composed of even smaller objects called quarks. Do quarks have quarks? What is a quark made of? Well that isn't our  job to answer but we could tell you that there are other extremely small particles that are called elementary particles that are to believed to be atomus (indivisible), such as an electron and so on. There are some characteristics that physicists or hobbiests could study to understand how quickly heavier particle decays into other lighter particles and eventually into elementary particles. But how?

A particle width or decay width is the measure of an unstable particle's energy speed, which is **inversely proportional** to its lifetime. So you can deduce that a wider width indicates a shorter lifespan which leads to a faster decay. How does this even relate to R(Ds)? Okay hold on let me cook for a bit.

Now consider the branching fraction which is the particle width of a specific decay over all decays. In other words it is the fraction of time a particle decays into a particular final state. We will denote the branching fraction by **B**. 




### 2. BDT:
In particle physics, when studying decays, there exists a lot of background (noise) which needs suppression. This background emerges from different types of decays,
